AgentCluster
=============

AgentCluster is a multi-agent based method for accurately and quickly clustering data into accurate groups. It has several benefits over other clustering techniques, including:
- No need to specify number of clusters
- Works equally well for centroid/density based cluster styles 
- Fuzzy clustering
- Superior to consensus clustering, and only a single method is used
- Highly parallelizable

The algorthim itself relies on a population of agents, each acting as a independant object that can interact with other agents in the swarm.
